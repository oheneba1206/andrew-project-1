            <h4>INDIVIDUAL PRAYER</h4>
            <h3>FOR YOU BEING A MAN OUGHT TO PRAY WITHOUT CEASING</h3>

            <p >Luke 18:1-14
                And he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint;
                2 saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not God, and regarded not man:
                3 and there was a widow in that city; and she came oft unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
                4 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;
                5 yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest she wear me out by her continual coming.
                6 And the Lord said, Hear what the unrighteous judge saith.
                7 And shall not God avenge his elect, that cry to him day and night, and (yet) he is longsuffering over them?
                8 I say unto you, that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
                9 And he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nought:
                10 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
                11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
